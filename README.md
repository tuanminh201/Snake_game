# Snake_game
A playable Snake Game

To run : python main.py

Hi, This is my first ever Python project using PyQT5. It was an asginment in Uni. It's just barely playable but this is considered to me as a trademark of how i have grown as a Developer.

Features:
  -You can write your name as a player
  -You can save your high scores
  -You can also change settings such as
    +Field Size
    +Turn Solid Walls on or off
    
    
Thanks for reading
